Visual represention of a Linked List

This project is written using python 3.  The purpose is to teach the fundamentals of linked list through visual representations explaining the code.  Driver.py is what most users will want to run, since this file provides a driver to call all the different operations for the linked list.  For specifics on commands use the keyword "help" when running the driver.
